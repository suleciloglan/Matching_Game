This project was developed as a school project. Unity and C# were the tools to develop this project.

# Requirements
1. To implement the scenes you need Unity_5.0.2f1_Plus
2. Ä°f MonoBehaviour doesn't work so you need Visual Studio to write C# codes.

That is actually all you need :) All you need is download this code and name it your project as "Second" ( as you can see ) and run the code :)

# What Does This Project Actually Do ?
This project originally was developed for Dyslexic children between 3 and 8. And stayed like that because improvements has stopped.

This Game presents 4 diffrent level for user. 

### Level 1

All pictures on the first level are shown clearly, and children are asked to match the shapes they see. The intention of this fairly simple level to determine that the intended children perceive the shapes they see correctly.

### Level 2

On the second level, pictures are closed but the number of closed pictures is small. The intention is to encourage children to use their memory. The reason of the small number of closed picture is not forcing the memory of the children so suddenly.

### Level 3

In the third and fourth levels, the pictures are still closed, but here levels present more pictures and mixed up the children's mind and determines the degree of development of visual memories of the children.

At the end of each level, if the game completed by the nearest amount of moves predicted gets the more stars. User gets at most four stars and at least one star.
