# Matching_Game

This project was developed as a school project. Unity and C# were the tools to develop this project.

# Requirements
1. To implement the scenes you need Unity_5.0.2f1_Plus
2. Ä°f MonoBehaviour doesn't work so you need Visual Studio to write C# codes.

That is actually all you need :) All you need is download this code and name it your project as "Second" ( as you can see ) and run the code :)
