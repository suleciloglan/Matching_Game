# Matching_Game

This project was developed as a school project. Unity and C# were the tools to develop this project.

# Requirements
1. To implement the scenes you need Unity_5.0.2f1_Plus
2. Ä°f MonoBehaviour doesn't work so you need Visual Studio to write C# codes.

That is actually all you need :) All you need is download this code and name it your project as "Second" ( as you can see ) and run the code :)

# What Does This Project Actually Do ?
This project originally was developed for Dyslexic children between 3 and 8. And stayed like that because improvements has stopped.

This Game presents 4 diffrent level for user. 

All pictures on the first level are shown clearly, and children are asked to match the shapes they see. The intention of this fairly simple level to determine that the intended children perceive the shapes they see correctly.
